# boto_bench

This project is a AWS S3/Lambda prototyper. It is _not_ meant for production,
simply for wrapping, pushing, and testing AWS Lambda functionality. 

This project started as a simple S3 workspace/stash for python variables
(generalized using Cloudpickle).

This project is a hack for Neurohack Week. Please don't flame me.

This project has borrowed heavily from:
- [Ryan Brown's sklearn-build-lambda](https://github.com/ryansb/sklearn-build-lambda)
- [Eric Jonas' pywren](https://github.com/pywren/pywren) (mostly in spirit)

This project relies on:
- [Reprozip](https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/reprozip)
- Hope

Its examples rely on:
- [Dipy](http://nipy.org/dipy/index.html)
